&emsp;Hello~,I'm Shi Chen, an ordinary student in School  of Physics, Peking University. This is my personal blog, the birthday of which is June 14th, 2017. I plan to write some naive conclusions or throughts here. The blog is named by ElectroMaster because my first research topic is non-sequential double ionization, the aim of  which is to manipulate electrons. In addition, ElectroMaster is the skill of my favourite anime character, Misaka Mikoto.
